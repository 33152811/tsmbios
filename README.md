The SMBIOS (System Management BIOS) is a standard developed by DMTF. The information stored in the SMBIOS typically includes system manufacturer, model name, serial number, BIOS version, asset tag, processors, ports and device memory installed.

The TSMBIOS project allows access the System Management BIOS (SMBIOS) using the Object Pascal language (Delphi or Free Pascal).
